      body: `**Org-mode** is a major mode for \`.org\` files — an outliner, task manager, notebook,
spreadsheet, and publishing system living in plain text:

\`\`\`org
* Project Phoenix          ← heading level 1
** Research               ← level 2 (more stars = deeper)
   Some notes here.
** TODO Write the report
   DEADLINE: <2026-07-20 Mon>
** DONE Setup repo
   CLOSED: [2026-07-10]
- [ ] checkbox item
- [X] done checkbox
\`\`\`

Because it's plain text: it diffs in git, greps with ripgrep, syncs anywhere, and
will still open in 30 years. Doom enables it via the \`:lang org\` module.

**The core interaction: TAB.** On a heading, \`TAB\` cycles fold states —
collapsed → children → everything. A 10,000-line file becomes a navigable outline.`,

      id: 'w8l2', type: 'info', title: 'TODOs, priorities, tags',
      body: `Any heading becomes a task by adding a TODO keyword. In Doom (evil bindings):

- \`SPC m t\` — cycle TODO state (TODO → DONE → none) on the current heading
- Shift-arrows also cycle states and priorities in org buffers
- \`[#A]\` \`[#B]\` \`[#C]\` — priorities: \`** TODO [#A] pay taxes\`
- \`:work:urgent:\` — tags at the end of a heading, set with \`SPC m q\`

Scheduling is first-class:

- \`SPC m d s\` — add a **SCHEDULED** date (when you plan to start)
- \`SPC m d d\` — add a **DEADLINE** (when it's due)

Dates use an interactive calendar. Once tasks have dates, the **agenda** turns
your scattered org files into a unified day/week planner.`,

      body: `The two commands that make org a *system* instead of a pile of files:

**Capture (\`SPC X\`)** — from ANY buffer, pop a small window, jot a thought,
hit \`C-c C-c\`, and it's filed into your inbox org file. Your flow is never broken.

**Agenda (\`SPC o A\`)** — scans all your org files and builds:
- a **day/week calendar** of everything scheduled and due
- a **global TODO list** filterable by tag, priority, keyword
- from the agenda you can reschedule (\`S-→\`), mark done (\`t\`), jump to the task (\`RET\`)

The famous workflow (GTD — Getting Things Done):
1. Capture everything instantly (\`SPC X\`), zero friction.
2. Review the inbox daily; schedule or file each item.
3. Live from the agenda, not from memory.

Tell Emacs which files feed the agenda:
\`\`\`elisp
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/org/inbox.org" "~/org/projects.org"))
\`\`\``,

        { q: 'What does TAB do on an org heading?', choices: ['Indents it', 'Cycles fold visibility', 'Marks it done', 'Creates a table'], answer: 1, explain: 'TAB cycles: folded → children → all. S-TAB cycles the whole file.' },

\`\`\`org
#+begin_src python :results output

\`\`\`

This enables **literate programming**: documents that mix prose, runnable code,
and results. Data scientists use it like Jupyter; sysadmins keep runnable runbooks.

The endgame flex: **a literate Doom config.** Write \`config.org\` with headings,
explanations, and elisp blocks — Doom tangles it into config.el automatically
(enable the \`:config literate\` module). Your editor config becomes a readable book
that *is* the implementation.
